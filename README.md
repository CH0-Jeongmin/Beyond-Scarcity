# Beyond-Scarcity

Exploring the feasibility of 'Practical Infinity' through the Penrose Process and its psychological implications on human motivation in a post-scarcity era.

**Phase 1: The Spark**  
This project originated from a question I had during an Economics class about the concept of 'Infinite Power'. I am starting this record to preserve the ideas I once shared to my teacher and the subsequent physical and psychological inquiries it inspired.

**Key Questions:**
1) Why does energy scarcity exist if energy is conserved?
2) Can I redefine the term 'Infinity' to 'Practical Infinity'?
3) Can the gradient of space-time warping enable the conversion of gravitational potential energy(GPE)?

**The Intellectual Journey**

[1]
- ​Started with a casual chat about 'Infinite Power' during Econ class.
- ​Defined Infinite Power: A system that sustains motion by self-circulating energy.

[2]
- Hypothesis 1: Are plants infinite power sources due to gas exchange?
​Reality Check: No. Absolutely dependent on external nutrients and light energy.
-​ Hypothesis 2: Is Earth a closed, infinite cycle?
​Reality Check: No. Energy quality degrades into heat. (Encountered Entropy).
- ​Realization: "Energy Depletion" isn't about energy disappearing; it's about the lack of useful energy.

[3]
- ​Question: Based on the Law of Conservation of Energy, is the Universe itself an infinite system?
​Obstacle: The Second Law of Thermodynamics proves no.
- ​Idea: Can we use Dark Matter/Energy like magnets (Gravity vs. Repulsion)?
​Verdict: Impossible. Too evenly distributed and extremely hard to harvest.

[4]
​- Proposal: What if we define it from a human perspective?: "Practical Infinity"
- ​If a resource outlasts human timescales (like Solar or Renewables), can we practically call it infinite?

[5]
- ​Observation: Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) is everywhere. Why can't we use it?
- ​Problem: Harvestable GPE requires a gradient. But spacetime is macroscopically flat.
- ​Twist: Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. Gravity warps space. Massive objects like Black Holes create extreme gradients.

[6]
- ​Research: Discovered the Penrose Process. Extracting energy from a rotating black hole is theoretically possible!
- ​Scalability: As the universe expands, black holes could grow and merge. Theoretically, energy could be harvested long after the predicted end of humanity.

[7]
- ​Vision: Send a machine to harvest and beam energy back to Earth.
- ​The Catch: Engineering limits. (Encountered Landauer's Principle).
- ​Realization: Self-repairing machines require information processing. Resetting bits generates entropy.

[8] Conclusion
- Practical Infinity is theoretically feasible if we overcome technical hurdles.
