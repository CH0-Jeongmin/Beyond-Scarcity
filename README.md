**Phrase 1: The Spark**  
This project originated from a question I had during an Economics class about the concept of 'Infinite Power'. I am starting this record to preserve the ideas I once shared to my teacher and the subsequent physical and psychological inquiries it inspired.

**Key Questions:**
1) Why does energy scarcity exist if energy is conserved?
2) Can I redefine the term 'Infinity' to 'Practical Infinity'?
3) Can the gradient of space-time warping enable the conversion og gravitational potential energy(GPE)?
